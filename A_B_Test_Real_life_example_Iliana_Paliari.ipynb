        "\n",
        "## Objective\n",
        "The objective of this A/B test is to determine whether changing the button color from **blue** (Group A) to **green** (Group B) increases conversion rates on an e-commerce website.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Hypothesis Formulation\n",
        "- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: There is no difference in conversion rates between the blue button and the green button.\n",
        "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: There is a difference in conversion rates between the blue button and the green button.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Sample Size Calculation\n",
        "The sample sizes were set at **1000 users** each for both groups (A and B), providing sufficient data to detect meaningful differences.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Randomization\n",
        "Users were randomly assigned to either Group A or Group B during simulation, ensuring that external factors did not bias the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Statistical Testing\n",
        "The calculated p-value from the z-test indicates whether we can reject H0:\n",
        "- If `p_value < alpha` (0.05), we reject H0; otherwise, we fail to reject it.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Confidence Intervals\n",
        "Confidence intervals provide insight into the reliability of our estimates:\n",
        "- **Confidence Interval for Group A (Blue Button)**: `[0.08, 0.12]`\n",
        "- **Confidence Interval for Group B (Green Button)**: `[0.10, 0.14]`\n",
        "\n",
        "These intervals suggest that we can be confident that the true conversion rates lie within these ranges.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Effect Size\n",
        "The difference in conversion rates provides an effect size that quantifies how much better one variant performs over another. This metric is crucial for understanding the practical significance of our findings.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Data Visualization\n",
        "### Conversion Rates\n",
        "Bar charts clearly show visual differences in conversion rates between groups:\n",
        "- **Group A (Blue Button)** Conversion Rate: **10%**\n",
        "- **Group B (Green Button)** Conversion Rate: **12%**\n",
        "\n",
        "### Overall Conversion Distribution\n",
        "Pie charts illustrate overall conversion distribution effectively, providing a quick overview of performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Interpretation of Results\n",
        "- If we reject H0 based on our p-value analysis and observe a significant difference (e.g., Group B has a higher conversion rate), we can conclude that changing the button color positively impacted conversions.\n",
        "- If we fail to reject H0, it suggests that any observed differences may be due to random chance rather than a true effect of changes made.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Iterate and Optimize\n",
        "Depending on results, further tests can be designed to refine strategies or explore other variants based on user feedback or behavior analysis. Continuous testing allows us to optimize user experience and maximize conversion rates over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "This example illustrates how to conduct an A/B test in a real-world scenario involving an e-commerce website's button color change. The results were analyzed effectively using statistical methods and visualizations. Adjusting parameters like sample sizes and conversion rates can help explore different scenarios within your testing environment."
